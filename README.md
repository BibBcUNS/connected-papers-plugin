# Connected Papers plugin

## About

This plugin integrates [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) (CP) with PKP-OJS, embedding the CP badge into the article details section. 

Connected Papers receives the article's DOI and checks whether it was successfully parsed by Semantic Scholar (at least one citation or reference are required to create a graph).

There are some controls to guarantee that the badge is only visible when there's a successful answer from CP.
